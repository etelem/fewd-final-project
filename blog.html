			<p>So – you hate your job. Why? Is it because you don’t like your actual work tasks? Perhaps.
			But if you dig deeper, there may be more to it than that. 
			
			Does your boss treat you well and recognize you when you go that extra mile for an assignment?
 			Do you have autonomy – are you allowed to work from home occasionally, or take time off?
			Do you have the tools you need – and a great physical working space?
 			
	If not you may be part of a company that is not working to get the best out of you.
	The good news? You can actually help change the culture of your company. Now if your boss is a jerk – there may only be so much you can do. But truly – you putting a little bit of effort can work wonders for yourself, your co-workers, and ultimately the performance of your company.
	Try using our culture generator to get ideas. 
	As per the energy project – people become engaged via4 categories – mental/emotional/physical/spiritual.
	They are yearning to feel like they a part of something, and you can help cultivate that feeling. Be nice. Plan small gathering and events. Celebrate birthdays, holidays, achievements. 
	You will be shocked by how much a ‘vibe’ will be reciprocated.</p> </li>

		<li class="two"> <img src="images/post2.png" id="main-image" alt="post2"> <p>So what is the best way to engage your employees? As mentioned on our data page, there are 4 core needs to meet - 1) Physical 2) Emotional 3) Mental 4) Spritual. Now it may take some convincing for your boss to listen (so print out our data page and show them)! Come up with ideas that you think fit both your company's existing culture but also would increase engagement in 1 category to start. Ask you boss if you can survey to measure results, and show that what you're doing makes a difference (I will be posting about surveying in the future for more specific insturcitons). Basically - show your boss some results, that your co-worker's work will improve, but also, that they will be less likely to leave (LEAVING your boss to hire someone new, which costs a boatload of $$$$$$.</p></li>
		
		<li class="three"> <img src="images/post3.png" id="main-image" alt="post3"><p>What if your boss is a jerk and won't listen? Well, this is tough. It is difficult to improve your company's culture if your leadership isn't onboard. However, you CAN take ownership of small things to make a difference. For instance, fight for 1 small thing - perhaps birthday a cake/card for each employees birthday. If you can institue 1 small intiative, you can make a difference in your co-worker's lives. That may not seem like a lot, but it can mean a whole lot to them! </p></li>
